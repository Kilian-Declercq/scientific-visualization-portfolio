# 🎨 Scientific Visualization & Research Communication

This repository centralizes the data visualization and scientific communication assets developed during my Master's research in **Computer Vision** and **Machine Learning**.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate how mathematical and physical concepts (Matrix Factorization, Multispectral Imaging, Deep Learning Architectures) can be made intelligible through a **visual and programmatic approach**.

## 📂 Repository Contents

### 1. 📜 ICCV 2025 Poster

### 2. 🎥 Mathematical Animations (Manim)
To bridge the gap between theory and intuition, I developed Python scripts using the **Manim** library to visualize the use of low-rank decomposition methods, such as NMF, applied to Multispectral Images.

**Key Concept:** How to interpret low-rank decomposition for Multispectral Images.
**Source Code:** [View Python Script](./src/manim_scripts/nmf_viz.py)
